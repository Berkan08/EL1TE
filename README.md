# EL1TE
Milestone project 1

This is my first project website to present to prospective employers. 
This site icludes a nice parallex scrolling effect that makes sense by properly placing meaningfull pictures.
It's build as a short sales pitch to get more customers.
It's small, informative, quick and uses a well thought-out logic.

## Demo
A live demo version can be found [here](https://d1ang.github.io/EL1TE/).

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access short informative B2B based site, while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design as possible.

### Scope
For B2B visitors, I wanted to provide them with a short overview of the products and the companies strongest points.
This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of what the company sells and would be a trustworthy partner to do business with.

### Structure
The site is structured to get the right information as quickly as possible.
Contact information on the top and further down buttons to get to the contact form.

### Surface
The colours blue and orange were used to create as high energy "sport" like feel.

## Technologies
1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)


## Features
This site uses a parallax scrolling effect in CSS to create a subtle element of depth that results in a distinctive and memorable website. 
The navbar collapsed on smaller screen sizes to be usefull one phones.
On larger screens a "call to action" bluebox wil appear so user can contact more quickly without scrolling trough the page.


### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add an ordersystem behind a login so excisting customers can order products more easily.
I would like to also add animations to the cards in the products and prices section to move on the page when the section is scrolled to. 


## Testing
All links will function but the socialmedia links will open the main page of the particular platform.
The "Send us your details" button will return to the home section.

This site was tested across multiple screen sizes on Chrome, Safari and Internet Explore
To ensure compatibility and responsiveness it was also tested on an android based mobile device (OnePlus5).
During the testing phase, I found out that ```Parallax scrolling effect``` was not compatible with Android chrome browsers.
The images will show but there will be no scrolling effect.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting the link into your terminal.
To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
